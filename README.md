# 📘 GitHub Collaboration Assignment

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository was created as part of our **GitHub Collaboration Assignment**. The goal is to practice Git best practices, branching strategies, branch protection rules, pull requests, code reviews, and collaborative workflows.  

Each team member contributed by:

- Creating a personal feature branch.
- Adding a markdown file with their **Name**, **Favorite DevOps Tool**, and **One Git Command Learned**.  
- Opening a Pull Request (PR) into the `develop` branch.  
- Reviewing and approving another team member’s PR.  
- Finally, merging `develop` into `main` (done by the Team Lead with approval).

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

1. **Team Lead** created the repository, `main` and `develop` branches, and set branch protection rules.  
2. **Each member** cloned the repo, created a feature branch, and added their markdown file.  
3. **Pull Requests (PRs)** were opened into `develop`.  
4. **Reviews**: Each member reviewed at least one PR.  
5. **Merging**: Team lead created a final PR to merge `develop` → `main`.

## ✅ Requirements Validation

To ensure compliance, a GitHub Actions workflow (`check-assignment.yml`) automatically validates:

- Each member has a `.md` file (not `README.md`).
- The file contains:  
  - **Name**  
  - **Favorite DevOps Tool**  
  - **Git Command Learned**  

PRs cannot be merged unless all checks pass.
